# Readme
This is the readme for my SkillsUSA project for the State SkillsUSA for Spring of 2023.

I had about 4 hours to work from scratch to build this program.

This is a simple app that simulates garbage diving to build an airplane and fly a course. You have to find 3 parts, engine, wings, and wheels. Once you find all of them, then you can
fly the course which has a randomize difficulty for each of the parts. If you succeed on all three parts of the course, then you win. If not then you fail.
