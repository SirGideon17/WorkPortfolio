This is a simple simulation to calculate the damage for a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) 5e adventuring party. I wanted to figure out how much damage the barbarian was doing and comparing that to my paladin at the time.
There is no UI once the simulation is run. What I would do is manually create the characters inside of the TheoryOfDamageMain.java class and then run the simulation.

Things that I want to improve on:
Create a main class that scans a file to build the characters when the simulation starts. That way I don't have to build the characters inside of the code and need to manually change it.
Create Once per round damage and Once per round dmaage dice. There are several ways that can happen in DnD and not having it can throw off my calculations.
Create individual advantage attacks. My paladin has that ability with the shortsword and while grappling.
