# Readme
This is the readme file for my TicTacToe Project.
I did this project for my class: Intro to Python Programming in Fall of 2023. This was one of the first programming classes that I took so this project was difficult at the time.
I also really enjoyed learning how to do the project and it was an excellent capstone for the project.
